            Sunday morning, give or take, a week after the new restrictions implemented in the South Korean 
            capital of Seoul. Me and my Korean friend decided to visit like every other weekend before this. 
            Like usual we didn't have a goddamn idea what to do. I already visited all the places that I wanted 
            to visit that I knew existed. <br><br> Had the liquid shits the day before (Saturday. The weekend, of all fucking 
            days) and was in the search of anything capable of staying solid in my system. We knew of this place that 
            sold udon in the district of Hongdae but my friend had the bright of idea of exploring to find other places 
            to eat. <br><br> We get off at Hapjeong or the stop before Hongkik University and step out of the metro station. 
            Honestly it had me thinking for a good minute. "Is this really the capital? Granted it is pretty early on 
            a Sunday but holy shit..." 
        </p>

            <em>>Seoul Bros...</em><br><br>
            It's dead out here famalams! Seems like a goddamn ghost town! There were more bikes being 
            sold that people on these streets. Luckily for me I'm not much of a people person so this is gold, 
            however for my friend it is another story. <br><br> The guy was starting to freak the fuck out  
            (extrovert problems) and went to take a quick cig break around the corner in an alley nearby. 10 minutes later
            of BSing and we continue our adventure. We walk to the nearest street down the alley and maaaannnn... 
        </p>

            Not a single car is running to the eye can see. Again, is this really the capital? I'm not in a small town here right?
            The biggest city in SK and there's more activity at the library back in my hometown from what I can remember at least. <br><br>
            My friend by now is convulsing and regretting getting off so soon. We kept walking looking for that one place;
            one restaurant had their window open but said they open until 1 PM. Damn we're hungry now and that's 4 hours later... <br><br>
            Kept on trucking for what seemed miles upon miles; parked cars, sidewalks with no people and the occasional abandoned bicycle.
            Eventually we reached a main avenue but the amount of cars seen were still lacking. Funny enough our walk ended with us reaching
            our original destination: Hongdae street. The amount of people was astonishing! 
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>>Packed to the brim!</em><br><br>
            We reached the store and I swear the lights were turned off; <strong>Damn the store is closed!</strong> My friend peeked inside and saw movement along
            with the elusive lights. Opened the door and it's completely empty. One of the employees, almost as if they were hiding came out from the back
            to greet us and put on their apron and hat. <br><br> We get our tickets from the vending machine and sign the COVID log. No one has signed
            in yet; we're the first customers of the day. Damn before this it has has never happened to us. Really makes you think... <br><br>
            Before the restrictions got set, we always went
            to Itaewon on the Sunday morning. For what you may ask? To keep on drinking of course! Given our current situation however, my doubts were really high
            if anything was even open. Like I said before, we have nothing else better to do so fuck it. <br><br> The exit in Hongkik University always has people, pandemic 
            or not, the airport line... is another story.

            Not all is lost though, my favorite Japanese brand outside of alcohol is also in SK for the clutch

            <em>>Got yo back patna</em><br><br>
            In Itaewon, the drinking street is holding a funeral. All is closed except for my Spanish bros and their bar. 
            We order a 3000mL serving plastic bottle and start pouring the fuckers. <br><br> My friend hits up another Korean guy
            that we hang out with once in a while. We finish the bottle and head towards Digital City station. Turns out this
            is the Hollywood of Korea as described by my friend. I'm thinking no fucking way until I the stars popped up...
        </p>

            Granted I didn't know a single fucking name on these stars. In contrast, he immediately recognized the first star 
            we crossed upon. <br><strong>BlackPink?</strong><br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            <i>"It's an actress from the early 2000's; very famous K-dramas!"</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            <em>>Right...</em><br><br> We continued walking looking for the other guy but he is nowhere to be found. We waited in the main
            square.

            <em>>Looks like a museum</em><br><br>
            Just like the other places, Hollywood is deserted. Such a big plaza and my eye catches around 10 people max.
            Some 10 minutes later the guy shows up outta nowhere. First thing I noticed
        </p>
        <h2>
            <i>"Damn...He lost weight!"</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sad state of affairs given that he looked so damn good when he was nice and thin. According to him, verbatim here:
            <br><strong>Too much beer</strong><br> The culprit of him being a fat fuck. <br><br> Nice to see him changing for the
            better; still the audacity on placing the blame on the golden liquid! We made our way to the nearest GS25 and bought
            some beer. Especifically some Terra and Hoeegarden or however you spell that shit. I definitely will review
            the other beer one of these days. <br><br>
            We drank outside the store for a good hour or so BSing and left for the nearest
            station exit <br><br><em>>Wage cucking soon</em><br><br> Took my happy ass home and they played b-ball with some 
            Koreans at a court on the way. They went drinking afterwards. <br><br><em>>WNGMI</em><br><br>

            Common theme overall? Goddamn ghost town. There's more activity on an anthill by the sidewalk. The soon to be skinny guy says
            that Hollywood used to do events where famous celebrities would come out of the studios and lines of fans would be losing their shit
            waiting for them. But like anything else the flu fucked that up. <br><strong>Shit</strong><br> I want to see a Kpop group live at least once...
