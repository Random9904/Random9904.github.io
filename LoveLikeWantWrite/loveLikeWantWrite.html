                My parents gave me a fountain pen for Christmas last year. That bad boy was $150 and you know what's it doing? Gathering dust in some drawer!
                <br><br>
                Imagine spending $150 on a writing utensil. Only for it to be a paperweight... Well at least it's resting on paper right?
                <br><br>

                <em>>This is the pen</em>
                <br><br>
                For me and I would imagine many others, writing, as an activity, is pure ecstasy. Putting that pen onto paper and making characters is a wonderful
                feeling.
                <br><br>
                However, I always had a problem <i>writing</i> in general. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>What does he mean by this?</strong>
                <br><br>
                I just, for the life in me, cannot <i>write</i> for the sake of writing.
                <br><br>
                <em>>brb let me write down the Bible with the fountain pen</em>
                <br>
                <em>>t. Not me</em>
                <br><br>
                I have to have some type of purpose before I can put that pen to dance. At work, I write tags as much as possible. During classes I 
                handwrite <i>everything</i> important the teacher says. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>MUH</strong> wrist be hurting and aching by the end but goshdarn it!
                <br><br>
                <strong>I'm gonna write!</strong>

                Learning Japanese is hard enough as it is. Imagine having to learn <i>three</i> alphabets to properly communicate a language. That pen is gonna thirst for paper...

                Feeling creative? You can do this on a computer, but it isn't the same if you know what I mean. Just saying but <i>To Kill a Mockinbird</i> wasn't made on a PC.
                Neither was <i>MacBeth</i> or <i>Starship Troopers</i>

                This one is harder to achieve because of pure sheer willpower. Would I go to a hard school, freefall into debt (but I have sCholArsHip), apply and other nonsense
                just for the benefit of writing?
                <br><br>
                <strong>Personally</strong>
                <br><br>
                I wouldn't.
                <br><br>
                You could be the exception to this. Nothing wrong with that. Heck, to hell with white collar work. <i>Any</i> work that requires writing could be doable.
                <br><br>
                Teachers, police (writing tickets), freelance writers, and who knows what.
