                Trains, taxis, helicopters, and fucking swimming. And for what!? For what!? With our balls melted to the side of our legs thanks to this 
                infernal oven called summer, we have finally arrived to the stadium! Yes sir! We here to see the big game bayyybbbeeeee! Baseball...

                <br><br>
                It's evening but the sun sure likes to remind us otherwise.
                Honestly first stadium in about one year and the place is looking massive. Lack of experience does that to you. We start searching for 
                the entrance and fuck I swear they hide it, so much so that we end up finding the gift shop...
                <br><br>
                <em>>Everytime</em>
                <br><br>
                We enter and split up. This store has all types of shit; jerseys, caps, flags, dolls and so much more. Their mascot, a ghost I believe, is pretty spooky.
                <br><br>
                I see a couple of nice jerseys of the local team, KT WIZ; black, white and other color variations. Very nice might I reiterate. Wouldn't mind buying one.

                Still a fat fuck in this timeline. No hate, just stating the facts. He'll slim down soon enough... Anyhow, I take his compliment to heart and say to myself, 
                <br>
                <strong>Fuck it why not?</strong>
                <br>
                Take a quick look towards the price tag...

                I put that shirt back on the rack with extreme prejudice and dusted it off just in case the Korean cashier accuses me of damaging merchandise.

                Fifteen minutes later I walk out with a spiffy cap, black and red themed; don't ask for the price since I ain't proud. <br><br> We exit and continue our search.
                Turns out we missed the big ass signs by the wall!
