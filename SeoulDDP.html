                Most of the people nowadays don't even know where their shoes are made.
                <br>
                What makes you think they know about their ancestry and background?
                <br><br>
                A lot of problems considered "modern" can be solved with solutions invented hundreds of years ago.
                <br><br>
                Created the next big thing?
                <br><br>
                Most than likely someone 200 years ago thought about it but couldn't bring it to reality with their current technology.

                Pay a visit to your local museum and learn about your past if it applies.
                <br><br>
                Need some answers? 
                <br>
                Don't know what to look for?
                <br><br>
                The museum probably has the solution.
                <br><br>
                Need some inspiration? 
                <br>

                People back then 9 times out of 10 had it worst than you and they survived.

                What they used and did to solve everyday problems might even surprise you...

                The video quality is somewhat dark but that's expected given the size of the lens on my equipment

                Nice experience but the price is outrageous
                <br><br>
                <strong>$20</strong>
                <br><br>
                For what turned out to be projections on walls
                <br><br>
                Definately needs a visit in person to fully appreciate it or hate it.
