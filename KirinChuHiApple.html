            It's said one in every thousand years a miracle happens that brings light to this dark, dark cold world. <br><br>
            Last time it happened we got the internet. <br><br> That was in 1000 AD... <br><br> From that point forward, humanity has made great strides.

            <em>>t. Me. The most faithful of drinkers</em><br><br>
            I would've never known if it wasn't for one of Amaterasu's chosen messengers. <br><br> As fable tells, in a local conbini outside of Gate 2 in Kadena's Air Base,
            the temple known as Lawson's. Lost, lacking in direction, I saw my savior in sandals and shorts burnt as if coming from the sun. <br><br> He strode with finesse to the 
            back of the temple and opened the massive cold doors to the unknown. Astonished, with a careful studious gaze, I witnessed greatness unfold upon my very
            eyes. <br><br> He took out a cylindrical object covered with silver multipolygonal edges! Not just one! But three! <br><br> <strong>Three!!!</strong><br><br>
            Scared at what I was witnessing, I stood back aghast! The saintly figure closed the massive doors, sealing back the freezing winds to another dimension. <br>
            <br> My curiosity was just too strong... Was I willing to follow this magnificent figure to the front? <br><br> What if it was to be my last breath? <br><br> With all my
            willpower, I prayed and gave chase! What happened next is for the history books...
