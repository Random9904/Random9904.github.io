            Back 2018-20 in Okinawa Japan, believe it or not, drunk was not in my vocabulary. 
            Alcoholic drinks tasted absolutely disgusting since my days as wee boy. The question was:
        </p>
        <h2>
            <i>"Why do people like to drink this shit?"</i>
        </h2>

            <em>>t. Young dumbass</em><br><br>
            As fate would have it, one fateful night on a weekend, a couple of bros that I met while in FTAC 
            were drinking in one of their rooms. They had all types of shit like Jaegerbombs, tequila, beers, Smirnoffs, 
            etc. Before this it was always just one drink for shits and giggles and I would call it a day / night. 
            One beer, one shot or matter of fact, one sip… However this night was different, my new bros were not having 
            it and also I was finally independent from my parents. They couldn’t say anything given that they were 7K or 
            more miles away back in the states. For the first time in my life I could do what I really wanted and fuck up 
            as I wanted without any advice or help. I truly was on my own in 24 years (SAD!)
            <br><br>
            One my of buds was like, “Damn that’s it? One shot? Is that really all you gonna drink tonight? 
            Might as well not even have come over tonight…” The moment he said that it truly hit me like a ton of bricks. 
            The hell I have been doing with my life all this time? I said fuck it and sent it. Being a lightweight, 5 shots and 
            2 beers later, I told my buds I was leaving back to my room. One step outside and fuck I swear the stairs started to 
            move by themselves! My foot moved to the right and my whole body said, “nah we going left instead”.
        </p>

            Although it did not make much sense at the moment, the loss of the future and simply living at the 
            present was liberating. What was I going to do tomorrow? The day after that? Years from now? Beats me! 
            Fuck it! An epiphany had hit me square in the jaw and knocked me out onto my bed. As I passed out, my mind 
            started rewiring itself to fit this new data. People don’t drink for the flavors or any of that silly shit; 
            they drink for the effects! The confidence, the stairs moving side to side, that one girl you swear she was ugly 
            as sin but now its 10/10 model… It all started to make sense now!

            You might say, “Nice blog fuckface. That’s all good and dandy but what the hell does that have to do 
            with Kirin Chu Hi Apple?” After my night episode, I woke up confident as ever. Alcohol was surely out of 
            my system by now but my curiosity was at an all time high. Yesterday the drinks definitely did the job but 
            man did some of them taste like pure shit. Surely there is a drink that will fuck my shit up in the most 
            pleasant of ways? I was in Okinawa after all… So I drove my happy ass to the nearest convenience store, the 
            Lawsons off gate 2 on Kadena Air Base. To my surprise the small stores are pretty stocked in all matters; 
            they even have fresh food in microwavable plates… I went to the nearest fridge and began my search for the 
            holy grail. Saw the beer bottles but what difference could it make with one from the states or another one 
            from Germany? Beer is beer taste wise so I skipped it; everybody makes beer so what’s special about it?
            <br><br>
            I looked up towards the higher isles and a sparkling bottle immediately caught my eye. 
            The contoured edges with an all Japanese font on a silver container. Wow! I took it out and it 
            shined bright as the sun reflected on it. It was a tall boi, 500mL, with a bunch of fruits on the front.
             Man it looks fruity! Really fruity! I had my doubts based from comments I heard yesterday about alcohol 
             tasting like fruits or looking like they came from them.

            Luckily for me, a Japanese person walked in and made a beeline towards my direction. 
            He waved his hand in a polite manner (universal for excuse me) and grabbed 5 of the tall bois. 
            I followed him low-key and saw that he just came in the store to buy the drinks and hauled ass soon after. 
            Well shit… I knew Japanese were alcohol aficionados even before I got to the island but I always thought 
            they did it with sake. At that point I had to buy the silver boi. Took my drink to the cashier and he scanned 
            it. Suddenly a pop up appeared on the screen: “Are you older than 20?” The hell is this I thought to myself and 
            looked at the cashier. He simply made a touching motion towards the screen and I complied. Yeah… in Japan they 
            simply go by the honor system unless you don’t look the part. How do I know this? One my baby faced friends got 
            carded multiple times; he said it was embarrassing.

            Drove to a nearby park to drink my drink. You might think this mofo is out here breaking laws in 
            the land of the rising sun; fucking Americans! However, open containers and overall consumption of 
            alcohol in public is legal in Japan so no biggie friends. It’s been a while since this happened but 
            I’m going to say Araha beach, I got there and parked my Kei car. It must have been really early since
             the people were definitely lacking at the moment. Looked for some shade to protect myself from the 100% 
             index sun; that fucker will cook you in a couple of minutes! Found a nice palm tree and took a seat under 
             it. Crack! Sipppppp! UMMM Yeah! No cap this tall boi hit pretty hard. She was going down refreshingly smooth 
             in this hot winter day. The taste of the fruits made the experience 10x better than it should. I could tell 
             the flavor would be stronger if it wasn’t for the sweetness. After a careful sipping of my silver bullet in 
             the span of 20 minutes or so, she was empty and I was nice and buzzed. Man! Those Japanese don’t know how 
             lucky they have it! No wonder they drink all days! Best part of all the drink to my recollection doesn’t 
             hurt as bad the next day. Get the gatorade or sports drink to rehydrate and you should be good to go.

             Kirin releases some temporary flavors across the year. They do oranges, grape, grapefruit and more.
              Take a quick trip to your nearest store and take a look if you have the chance. For me? Apples. Yes.
               Apples. The flavor those fruits bring with the alcohol transcend to another dimension. Only bad part 
               is apple is usually a season thing. <strong>Fuckers…</strong>
