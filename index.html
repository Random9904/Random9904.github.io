                Straight from the land down under― in South Korea.

                Given that it is a beer, depending on the individual(s), the amount needed for a true good buzz varies widely. 
                Sober sallies and the frequent designated driver might fall victim to a single tall boi (500mL). 
                For the true connoisseurs or of those wanting a Korean staple then the mixing of alcohol is recommended. 
                However not just any alcohol, only soju or the Korean rice spirit will do.
                <br><br> <strong>PROTIP #-1</strong> <br><br>

                </em>
                <br><br>   
                Have your youngest Korean friend pour the table’s shot glasses with soju. 
                Repeat with the beer glasses about 3/4 full of Terra. 
                Take your respective shot glass and pour into the beer glass. Grab one chop stick and stick it into the beer glass. 
                Using the other chop stick, hit the chop stick in the glass with the force of a thousand suns. 
                If done correctly, the drink should bubble up suddenly and calm itself within seconds. Sip and enjoy or do as Koreans do, 
                chug her down in one gulp.

                The branding might be somewhat confusing. The hops themselves come all the way from Australia to SK. 
                They are then in turn made into beer there.

                Best part is you don’t even have to go far to catch one. 
                A quick trip to a GS25 (Korean convenience store) for a low low price of ₩2000 (give or take) for one of the tall boys. 
                Crack her open and before you know a crisp and smooth flavor goes down nice and easy. Guaranteed. 
                Apart from the tall boys, you can also buy the normal sized can, glass bottles and a big plastic bottle fit for a 
                group. I see you alcoholics… The most expensive I have seen them around was $8 for the glass bottle and 
                that was in an underground bar in Itaewon. The bar and the foreigner tax were definitely applied to reach 
                such outrageous prices. Apart from that, to my knowledge, you can really drink anywhere in SK no questions asked. 
                For any Americans out there, you know that public drinking is a big no-no. Over here as long as you are not 
                bothering anyone then the ground is the limit.

                Whether a bar, club, watering hole, pissing center, and other fine establishments, 
                9 times out 10 the place you are in will have Terra in stock. Feeling the blues? Don’t know why? 
                Definitely knew that feeling last week. Know what immediately fixed me up? A sip of Terra beer! Guaranteed!
