                Finally coming back home to the USA after 3 years of living in Asia. Japan and South Korea to be exact.
                <br><br>
                Wanted to end the New Years with a <br><br> <strong>BANG</strong> <br><br> I went online and started my search a week before hand. 
                YouTube videos, online blogs, everything I could get my hands on.
                <br><br>
                After much searching, Lotte Tower was the place. Right at midnight, a steady but electrifying stream 
                of fireworks cover the sky. The spectacle lasts a good while, something I have never seen for that long or that
                grand.
                <br><br>
                <strong>GOTS TO GO</strong> 
            </p>

                <em>>In my dreams</em>
                <br><br>
                There's a slight setback...
                <br><br>
                <strong>COVID</strong>
                <br><br>
                Surely this pandemic would not ruin my evening right? Will the master party pooper ruin another night?
                <br><br>
                <em>>AnOtHeR!?</em>
                <br><br>
                I take the subway to the tower to buy some clothes at the MUJI. While the shop employee helps me with the sizes,
                I ask him
                <br><br>
                <em>
                    >There is going to be fireworks tonight at midnight?
                    <br>
                    >Sorry but not tonight
                </em>
                <br><br>
                I buy my pieces of fabric and go to different stores, asking every single employee I can get my hands on. 
                Their answer?
                <br><br>
                <strong>NO</strong>
                <br><br>
                It got to the point I even asked the cleaning ladies and some customers walking around. No one knew.
                I exit the mall and head towards a skating rink nearby...
